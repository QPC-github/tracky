  <em>Record an ARKit session for reconstruction in Blender</em>
 </p>
</p>

## Background

We developed this tool because we wanted to experiment with new AR ideas
faster. By capturing an ARKit session (including its depth data, its
segmentation masks, all of its positional and orientation streams, stereo
microphone audio, and any detected planes) we can reconstruct it in Blender.
Once in Blender, we can quickly iterate on concepts and see the results as they
would look in an ARKit session.

## Prerequisites

* XCode 14.2 or higher
* Blender 2.8 or higher
